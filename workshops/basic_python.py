# Basic Python Workshop
# William Soylemez - Robotics 2025

# This workshop covers basic Python programming concepts including:
# - Variables and Data Types
# - Control Structures (if statements, loops)
# - Functions
# - Basic Input/Output


# Warmup: Run this file in your terminal using the command:
# python workshops/basic_python.py
# You should see "Hello, Robotics 2025!" printed in the terminal.
print("Hello, Robotics 2025!")

# Exercise 1: Variables and Data Types
# Create a variable called 'robot_name' and assign it your favorite robot name as a string
# Then print "My robot's name is <robot_name>"


# Exercise 2: Input/Output
# Use the input() function to ask the user for their favorite robot name
# Store the input in a variable and print "Your favorite robot is <user_input>"


# Exercise 3: Control Structures
# Write a simple if statement that checks if the user input variable is "Robo"
# If it is, print "That's a cool name!"
# Otherwise, print "Nice name!"


# Exercise 4: Loops
# Write a for loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 5
# Then write a while loop that counts down from 5 to 1


# Exercise 5: Functions
# Write a function called greet_robot that takes a robot name as a parameter
# The function should print "Hello, <robot_name>!"
# Call the function with your robot_name variable
